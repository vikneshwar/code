/*
LCM - Least commom multiple 
Ex: LCM of 4 and 6 ??
	multiples of 4 --> 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44...
	multiples of 6 --> 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60, 66 ..
	Common multipes --> 12(least), 24, 36 ...
	LCM --> 12 
GCD - Greatest common divisor 
Ex: GCD of 54 and 24 ??
	divisors of 54 --> 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, 54
	divisors of 24 --> 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24
	Common divisors --> 1, 2, 3, 6(greatest) 
	GCD --> 6
