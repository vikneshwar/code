/*
 As you have study in mathematics that in decimal number system even numbers are divisible by 2 while odd are not so we may use modulus operator(%) which returns remainder, For example 4%3 gives 1 ( remainder when four is divided by three). Even numbers are of the form 2*p and odd are of the form (2*p+1) where p is is an integer.
