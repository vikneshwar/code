/*
In c programming language when we divide two integers we get an integer result, For example the result of 7/3 will be 2.So we can take advantage of this and may use it to find whether the number is odd or even. Consider an integer n we can first divide by 2 and then multiply it by 2 if the result is the original number then the number is even otherwise the number is odd. For example 11/2 = 5, 5*2 = 10 ( which is not equal to eleven), now consider 12/2 = 6 and 6 *2 = 12 ( same as original number). These are some logic which may help you in finding if a number is odd or not.
