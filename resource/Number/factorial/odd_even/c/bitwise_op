/*
We can use bitwise AND (&) operator to check odd or even, as an example consider binary of 7 (0111) when we perform 7 & 1 the result will be one and you may observe that the least significant bit of every odd number is 1, so ( odd_number & 1 ) will be one always and also ( even_number & 1 ) is zero.
